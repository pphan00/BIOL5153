#### **Research Interests**
My interests lie between investigating the biochemical properties of snake venoms, especially pygmy rattlesnakes, and their potential medical applications. Additionally, I am interested in chromatography and NMR techniques in biochemistry. However, I am not limited to these fields and opened to other areas such as protein engineering, biocatalysis, cancer biology, and neuroscience.
